      <h1>The Pack of Biscuits</h1>
      <p>
        One night there was a woman at the airport who had to wait for several
        hours before catching her next flight. While she waited she bought a
        book and a pack of biscuits to spend the time. She looked for a place to
        sit and waited. She was deep into her book, when suddenly she realized
        that there was a young man sitting next to her who was stretching his
        hand, with no concern whatsoever, and grabbing the pack of cookies lying
        between them. He started to eat them one by one. Not wanting to make a
        fuss about it she decided to ignore him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The woman, slightly bothered, ate the cookies and watched the clock,
        while the young and shameless thief of biscuits was also finishing them.
        The woman started to get really angry at this point and thought, «If I
        wasn’t such a good and educated person, I would have given this daring
        man a black eye by now.» Every time she ate a biscuit, he had one too.
        The dialogue between their eyes continued and when only one biscuit was
        left, she wondered what was he going to do. Softly and with a nervous
        smile, the young man grabbed the last biscuit and broke it in two. He
        offered one half to the woman while he ate the other half. Briskly she
        took the biscuit and thought, «What an insolent man! How uneducated! He
        didn’t even thank me!»
      </p>
      <p>
        She had never met anybody so fresh and sighed relieved to hear her
        flight announced. She grabbed her bags and went towards the boarding
        gate refusing to look back to where that insolent thief was seated.
        After boarding the plane and nicely seated, she looked for her book
        which was nearly finished by now. While looking into her bag she was
        totally surprised to find her pack of biscuits nearly intact. If my
        biscuits are here, she thought feeling terribly, those others were his
        and he tried to share them with me. Too late to apologize to the young
        man, she realized with pain, that it was her who had been insolent,
        uneducated and a thief, and not him!

      <h1>A Good Lesson</h1>
      <p>
        Once a rich Englishwoman called Mrs Johnson decided to have a birthday
        party. She invited a lot of guests and a singer. The singer was poor,
        but he had a very good voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The singer got to Mrs Johnson’s house at exactly six o’clock as he had
        been asked to do, but when he went in, he saw through a door that the
        dining-room was already full of guests, who were sitting round a big
        table in the middle of the room. The guests were eating, joking,
        laughing, and talking loudly. Mrs Johnson came out to him, and he
        thought she was going to ask him to join them, when she said, «We’re
        glad, sir, that you have come. You will be singing after dinner, I’ll
        call you as soon as we’re ready to listen to you. Now will you go into
        the kitchen and have dinner, too, please?» The singer was very angry,
        but said nothing. At first he wanted to leave Mrs Johnson’s house at
        once, but then he changed his mind and decided to stay and teach her and
        her rich guests a good lesson. When the singer went into the kitchen,
        the servants were having dinner, too. He joined them. After dinner, the
        singer thanked everybody and said, «Well, now I’m going to sing to you,
        my good friends.» And he sang them some beautiful songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon Mrs Johnson called the singer. «Well, sir, we’re ready.» «Ready?»
        asked the singer. «What are you ready for?» «To listen to you,» said Mrs
        Johnson in an angry voice. «Listen to me? But I have already sung, and
        I’m afraid I shan’t be able to sing any more tonight.» «Where did you
        sing?» «In the kitchen. I always sing for those I have dinner with.»
